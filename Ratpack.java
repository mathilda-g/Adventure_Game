                A pack of rabid rats surges through the mall like a chaotic, writhing mass of fur, teeth, and claws. 
                Their bodies, numbering in the dozens or even hundreds, are mottled with patches of mangy fur, tufts missing where disease has ravaged their once sleek coats. 
                The rats vary in size, some as large as small cats, with their muscular forms twitching and jerking with unnatural energy. 
                Their thin, whip-like tails lash the ground behind them, dragging through the dirt and grime, adding to the noise of their frenzied scurrying. 
                Foam bubbles and drips from the corners of their mouths, a clear sign of the rabies coursing through their bodies. 
                Their sharp, yellowed teeth are constantly exposed, gnashing together with an audible grinding sound. 
                
                The smell of the pack is overpowering. A thick, nauseating stench of decay, rot, and disease. 
                The air around them is thick with the odor of sweat, blood, and festering wounds, combined with the sickly-sweet smell of their frothing mouths. 
                Their movement is erratic and terrifyingly fast. 
                They dart forward in a jerking, frantic fashion, never moving in a straight line but instead twisting and turning unpredictably. 
                As they move the sound is relentless, high-pitched squeals, the gnashing of teeth, the scratching of claws, all of it amplified by the sheer number of bodies moving as one. 
                By each second, they\'re inching closer to you.

                As the pack of rats surges toward you, the adrenaline kicks in, and you make a desperate dash to escape. 
                You can hear the relentless squeals and the scratching of their claws on the ground behind you, growing louder, closer. 
                Just as you reach a narrow corridor, the first of them lunges at your legs, a flash of mangy fur and teeth. 
                You kick out instinctively, but one of them manages to sink its teeth into your ankle. 
                The pain is sharp and immediate, like a jagged knife slicing through your flesh. 
                You stumble, almost falling, but catch yourself against the wall. 
                Your heart pounds as you feel the rat\'s weight hanging from your ankle, its jaws locked tight, teeth grinding against bone.
                """, """
                The pack of rats surges toward you, a wave of gnashing teeth and frantic energy. 
                Panic floods your system as you turn to run, but their speed is overwhelming. 
                Before you can get far, the first rat leaps at your leg, its claws digging into your skin. 
                You feel a sharp, searing pain as its teeth sink deep into your calf. 
                Your body tenses in shock, but there\'s no time to react. 
                The rest of the pack follows, swarming you like a tidal wave of fur and frenzy. 

                They claw and bite with savage intensity, their sharp teeth tearing through your clothes and skin, ripping into muscle with a sickening crunch. 
                Their sheer numbers overwhelm you in seconds. 
                You try to fight them off, your hands swatting in a desperate attempt to push them away, but they are everywhere, crawling up your arms, biting into your flesh, even latching onto your face. 
                The sensation is unbearable: a constant, searing pain as dozens of tiny mouths gnaw at you relentlessly. 
                You can feel their claws raking across your skin, peeling away layers as they bite deeper. 
                The froth from their mouths smears across your skin as they bite down, infecting every wound with rabies. 
                Your vision blurs as they tear at your eyes, and the metallic taste of blood fills your mouth as they bite into your lips, gnashing teeth against bone. 

                Your screams are lost beneath the deafening squeals of the pack. 
                The rats chew and burrow into every inch of your body, gnawing through nerves and tendons, reducing your movements to feeble twitches. 
                The pain fades to numbness as your body succumbs to shock, but the image of them. 
                Those yellowed teeth, those wild, rabid eyes, burns into your mind as the last thing you see. 
                Darkness claims you, but the gnawing continues long after.

                First, you run toward the nearest store with a wide entrance to put some distance between you and the approaching pack. 
                The rats are fast, but you are faster, for now. 
                You slam the glass door shut behind you, buying yourself a few precious seconds. 
                You quickly grab whatever is near the door, clothes racks, a bench, or even mannequins, and shove them against the entrance to create an improvised barrier. 
                It\'s not perfect, but it will slow them down. 
                The rats slam into the glass, claws scratching, their squeals filling the air as they push against the door, but you know they\'ll break through soon. 
                The first rat bursts through the door, squeezing through the crack it\'s gnawed open. 
                Its eyes are wild, saliva dripping from its jaws as it scurries forward, claws clicking on the tiled floor. 
                More follow, pushing their way inside. 
                
                Desperate, you back up to the store\'s counter, spotting a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall. 
                Perfect. You grab it and rip it off the mount, holding it up like a shield. 
                As the rats close in, you spray the thick foam at the swarm, the blast disorienting them. 
                The cold, pressurized cloud blinds them, sending them into a frenzy of confusion. 
                Using the extinguisher as a blunt weapon, you swing it down with all your strength, crushing several of the rats under its weight. 
                Each swing sends more of them flying, their bodies breaking under the force of the heavy metal canister. 
                With the swarm now thinned out, the remaining rats are struggling to regroup. 
                You take the chance to make a break for it, vaulting over the counter and rushing out of the store. 
                You don\'t stop running, knowing that while you\'ve dealt with the immediate threat, the mall is still crawling with danger.
