                The leader of the pack is a truly monstrous rat, far larger than the rest, standing nearly three times their size. 
                It towers over the others, as large as a medium-sized dog, with a hulking, muscular frame that ripples under its patchy, mangy fur. 
                The fur, matted with filth, blood, and grime, clings in tufts to its hide, leaving exposed patches of rough, scaly skin that glisten with a sickly sheen. 
                The rat\'s hide is battle-scarred, riddled with old wounds and deep gashes from past fights, evidence of its dominance and long survival in a brutal world. 
                Its head is enormous, broad and flat, with jagged, discolored teeth that protrude from its mouth like broken shards of bone. 
                These teeth are yellowed and cracked, but incredibly sharp, grinding together with an audible snap as the rat gnashes its jaws. 
                Two long, curled fangs jut downward from its upper jaw, dripping with foamy saliva. 
                
                Its maw is perpetually open, revealing a cavernous mouth that can easily tear through flesh and bone. 
                The foam is thick and frothy, streaked with blood from previous kills. 
                The rat\'s eyes glow an unnatural red, bulging from its skull as if on the verge of popping out. 
                Its pupils contracted into thin slits, twitching and flicking in every direction, never resting. 
                Unlike the smaller rats, whose movements are jerky and erratic, this beast moves with a terrifying purpose. 
                Every step is heavy and deliberate, its claws digging deep into the ground as it strides forward, scattering the smaller rats in its wake. 
                """, """
                It lunges forward, jaws snapping with a feral snarl. 
                You barely have time to react as it bears down on you, its massive frame a blur of movement. 
                As it strikes, you instinctively raise your arms to shield yourself, but its powerful jaws clamp down on your forearm, the jagged teeth slicing through skin and muscle like paper. 
                Pain explodes through your body, searing and sharp, but you manage to twist away just enough to avoid a fatal bite. 
                The weight of the rat pushes you backward, and you stumble, trying to regain your balance. 
                """, """
                As the monstrous rat locks its glowing red eyes on you, there's a split second where time seems to freeze. 
                Its hulking, muscular frame ripples as it starts to move, each step deliberate and terrifying. 
                The sound of its claws scraping against the ground echoes through the narrow, shadowy space you're trapped in. 
                The smaller rats scatter, leaving a clear path for their leader to close the distance with terrifying speed. 
                
                Before you can react, the rat lunges. Its jagged teeth snap together with a sickening crack, narrowly missing your face. 
                The stench of decay and blood fills the air as its hot, foamy breath washes over you. 
                With a powerful swipe of its clawed paw, it sends you sprawling to the ground. 
                The impact knocks the wind out of you, and you can feel its claws raking across your chest, tearing through your clothes and skin with ease. 
                Gasping for air, you struggle to get up, but the rat is already on you. 
                Its massive jaws clamp down on your shoulder, the sharp fangs easily piercing flesh and muscle. 
                The pain is excruciating, but what makes it worse is the gnashing—those discolored, broken teeth grind through bone with a sickening crunch. 
                
                You scream, but the sound is drowned out by the rat's guttural growl as it shakes you violently, like a predator toying with its prey. 
                It doesn\'t end quickly. The rat toys with you, pinning you down with its immense weight. 
                Its claws dig into your sides as it bites down again, this time on your neck. 
                The world begins to blur as your body weakens, the blood loss too much. 
                The last thing you hear is the sound of its teeth grinding together, the wet, tearing sound of flesh, and the awful, thick froth of saliva mixing with your blood. 
                Then, darkness.
                """, """
                The rat lets out a guttural growl, then charges with terrifying speed, its massive form closing the distance faster than you expected. 
                You duck behind a nearby clothing rack, shoving it toward the rat as it barrels forward. 
                The rack crashes into its legs, but the beast barely falters, smashing through it with raw power. 
                You need something stronger to stop its momentum. 
                You run into a nearby sporting goods store, the rat still in pursuit. 
                Inside the store, you grab a sturdy aluminum baseball bat from a display. 
                It\'s not much, but it\'s better than nothing. 
                
                You also spot cans of spray paint and lighter fluid on a shelf nearby, potential weapons if used correctly. 
                You stuff a few into your pockets, hoping to use them later. 
                The rat bursts into the store, its massive bulk knocking over shelves as it forces its way inside. 
                You swing the bat with all your strength, smashing it across the rat\'s face. 
                The impact sends a jolt through your arms, but the rat barely flinches, only snarling louder. 
                It swipes at you with one massive paw, and you barely manage to dodge, the claws missing your torso by inches. 
                Remembering the lighter fluid, you pull a canister from your pocket and spray it at the rat\'s face, hoping to blind or disorient it. 
                The rat screeches as the chemical splashes into its eyes, causing it to thrash around wildly. 
                You take the opportunity to grab a lighter from a nearby counter, igniting the fluid with a quick flick. 
                
                The rat\'s fur catches fire, and the beast lets out an ear-piercing howl of pain. 
                Flames race across its back and sides, causing it to thrash even more violently. 
                Its eyes are wild with rage, and it snaps at you as you get closer. 
                You wait for the right moment, when it turns its head, exposing its side. 
                With all the strength you can muster, you bring the bat down to the back of its neck. 
                There\'s a crack as the blow connects, and the rat collapses, its legs giving out beneath it. 
                Breathing heavily, you drop the bat and stagger back, the adrenaline still coursing through your veins.
