            Close by you hear footsteps approaching slowly and a low guttural moan intermittently. 
            Curious on what it may be you sneak up closer to get a look. 
            What you see is a person wearing a hoodie and jeans, tattered and covered in grime and... blood? 
            The face seems almost lifeless with its jaw hanging slightly agape revealing just a few teeth remaining, smeared with dark, coagulated blood. 
            Its skin appears to be sickly greenish grey and stretched tightly over its skeletal features. Clumps of hair cling to its scalp, greasy and matted with dried blood and dirt. 
            
            The eyes are glassy and vacant, staring ahead into nothing. 
            Its movements are slow and jerky, dragging one foot slightly behind. 
            Taken aback of what you just saw, you didn\'t notice the broken glass bottle beside you, accidentally kicking it. 
            The zombie\'s gaze flicked instantly and started moving towards you.  
            """, """
            As the zombie charges toward you with surprising speed, you barely manage to take a step back before it lunges, its filthy hand slamming into your chest with unexpected force. 
            The impact knocks the wind out of you, sending you stumbling backward. 
            Your ribs ache from the hit, the pain sharp and immediate. 
            """, """
            As soon as the sound of the bottle shattering echoes, the zombie\'s vacant, glassy eyes lock onto you with sudden intensity. 
            It lets out a raspy, guttural growl, dragging its stiff leg faster now, lurching in your direction. 
            Panic floods through your body, your mind racing for a way out, but the creature is relentless, closing the distance quickly despite its awkward gait. 
            Before you can react, it's upon you. Its decaying hands, caked with filth, grab your arm with an iron grip far stronger than you expected. 
            The stench of death floods your senses as it pulls you in closer, jaw dropping open, revealing its remaining teeth stained with dried blood. 
            You struggle, but its dead weight overpowers you as you tumble to the ground. 
            The zombie\'s face inches closer to yours, its breath a mix of decay and rot. 
            
            With terrifying strength, it forces your head to the side, exposing your neck. 
            Then, with a sickening crunch, its jagged teeth sink into your flesh, tearing into muscle and tendon as blood pours from the wound. 
            The pain is excruciating, but it quickly dulls as shock takes over. 
            You feel the warmth of your own blood soaking your clothes, your heartbeat hammering in your ears. 
            The world blurs, your vision dimming as the monster feasts hungrily. 
            The last thing you hear before everything goes black is the wet, grisly sound of it devouring your flesh, your body going cold in its grip. 
            """, """
            You run around trying to find a weapon to help you fight it, spotting a car, you rush towards it, heart pounding. 
            You yank open the driver\'s side door. 
            With the door wide open, you step inside. 
            The zombie lurches closer, its vacant eyes fixated on you. 
            As the zombie draws near, its outstretched arms reaching for you, you suddenly swing the door shut with all your might. 
            The metal slams against the zombie with a bone-crushing force, the sickening sound of flesh meeting steel echoing through the parking lot. 
            
            You aim for the side of its head, hoping to catch it off guard. 
            The door collides with the zombie\'s head, caving it in and effectively neutralizing the threat. 
            The creature falls limp, its body crumpling against the asphalt, blood pooling beneath it. 
            You step out of the car, breathless and adrenaline-fueled, scanning the lot for other zombies that may have been attracted by the noise.
